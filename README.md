# responsive-layout-garden

Here's one way you could go about it...

What do you think?

(we'll fill in the purpose and things here)

This leads into modular theme development, design systems, all sorts of JS ideas, - but really - at it's heart, it's about learning all of the flexbox and grid layouts. Also good for live style guide discussion.

We'll work out a build step at some point, but for now we're just dragging it to FTP. We can set it up with deploybot later.

(don't expect that to be up to date until the build step is in place)
