# responsive-layout-garden

Here's one way you could go about it...

What do you think? Is the way we decided to name the module files going to come back to haunt us?

(we'll fill in the purpose and things here)

This leads into modular theme development, design systems, all sorts of JS ideas, - but really - at it's heart, it's about learning all of the flexbox and grid layouts. Also good for live style guide discussion.

We'll work out a build step at some point, but for now we're just dragging it to FTP. We can set it up with deploybot later.

(don't expect that to be up to date until the build step is in place)

## Things we could do

* Save color choices to local storage
* Create a color controls block for each section/module
* Create a type-pattern custimization system
* Create a page where you can pick and choose your modules and construct a page on the fly
* Allow states to be saved and shared at a special URL
* Get the sections backed by data/json
* ...
* And really: Just make a lot of really interesting modules
